 <p>Everyone in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering is a member of CSEA. In addition, there is a team of active members - the executives, who organize all the activities of CSEA.</p> 
 
 <p>Executive induction for BTech students takes place in their second year. The inductions are informed about well in advance and anyone interested can apply. The selection is done by the current executives on the basis of the information provided by the applicants in their application apart from onsite interviews. MCA students have similar pattern of induction. MTech executives are elected by their batches or nominated by the faculty.</p>
 
 <p>Apart from the formal inductions, we look for people who are truly interested in working for the association and they can contact us even later if they missed out during the inductions.</p>
